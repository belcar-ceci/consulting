# THE CODER'S OFFICE 👩‍💻

## Introduction 📋

The project "THE CODER'S OFFICE" is an application that allows you to request an appointment with the CTO to solve technical problems of the development teams. \
The objective is to develop a minimum viable product (MVP) in PHP, and we will try to create an object-oriented application using the MVC (Model-View-Controller) pattern.

## Structure 🧬

### The application will consist of at least 3 pages:

- One page for the list with all scheduled appointments
- A second page with a form to create a new appointment
- A third page to edit a specific appointment

### Appointment List:

- Appointments should appear in order of creation with:
  - The name of the coder or team
  - The subject of the query
  - Date and time of creation of the appointment.
  - Appointments can be deleted
  - We can access the edition of each appointment, and the page for creating a new appointment

### Create new appointment:

- Form with the required fields
- Button to clear fields
- Button to cancel and return to the main list
- Button to send the information

### Edit appointment:

- Form with the required fields
- The fields must have the information of the appointment to be edited
- Cancel button, Submit button

### The application must be responsive
